# Work status

Whole request: IN_PROGRESS. The 250,000-line Core goal is not reached.
Latest cloc 2.11 count: 5,022 authored Julia Core code lines across 44 files;
CLI/TUI add 407 lines and are counted separately. This is 2.0088% of the
minimum line target, leaving 244,978 lines. These are early implementations,
not a mature agent or a complete synthesis of the upstream projects. Reproduce
with `python scripts/core_size.py`; source-size ratios are not feature completion.

Read `docs/requirements/reconstruction.md` for the reconciled requirements.
Prepared: 22 shallow upstream research repositories, Julia 1.11.7 from the
verified official OCI layer, one main checkout. Reference notes are recorded
before application implementation. No copied project directories or worktrees.

Verified checkpoint: five streaming model protocols (OpenAI Chat/Responses,
Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama) using loopback HTTP fixtures; provider-native reasoning
replay; bounded tool arguments; retry before delivery only; hash-guarded edits;
process groups, stdin, retained bounded output and cancellation/timeouts;
bounded parallel tools with exclusive barriers; persistent agent loop, context
projection, headless CLI and configuration profiles/CAS. One deterministic
agent fixture repairs a real failing Python unittest. This uses MockProvider,
not a live model; no live-model or multilingual benchmark claim is made.

`test/runtests.jl`: 119 assertions passed on Linux, Julia 1.11.7, four threads,
2026-10-03. Evidence: `docs/validation/core-checkpoint-001.json`.
Interface checkpoint: versioned framed stdio RPC, scoped approval responses,
asynchronous start/steer/cancel, config CAS and in-memory credential snapshots;
30 protocol assertions and 16 terminal assertions passed. Actual PTY validation
verifies TUI task/approval/Unicode write/exit. Node transport talks to the real
Julia Core and rejects malformed child framing (two passing tests).
Standalone VSIX packages successfully (~62 KiB; authored Core source included,
Julia runtime/dependencies must be installed separately). Native Code-OSS
Workbench/shared-process overlay passes the complete upstream client typecheck
and a real GUI HTTP/tool/approval/file-write test with extensions disabled.
This is a development desktop runtime, not a completed desktop distribution.
Full built-in-extension packaging and Windows installer validation are pending.
MCP integration and real OS isolation remain unfinished.
Core remains far below the 250,000-line delivery target.

Storage hardening: atomic replacement now uses OS replacement primitives;
Unix file/directory flushes; bounded journal record reads; shared-ledger checks
under its mutex; finite provider/budget values. Windows 64-bit file flush,
replacement and cross-process lock source is present but not runtime-verified.
Broad Linux suite: 165 assertions passed after shared storage changes; targeted
atomic/bounded-record tests: five passed; finite-config tests add two cases.

Full-project research inventory: `docs/architecture/capability_matrix.md` covers
all 22 pinned checkouts. Rows distinguish research directions from verified
implementations; no complete-synthesis or model-quality claim is made.

Memory checkpoint: workspace/session/user namespaces, provenance/content hashes,
CAS, tombstones, eight-revision histories, expiry, lexical BM25 with Chinese
characters/bigrams and atomic import/export. Nonblocking cross-process locks
fix worker starvation under concurrent writes. Broad affected suite: 204 passing
assertions (32 new memory assertions). `docs/core/memory.md` describes limits.

Next: compiler-semantic project backend; durable tasks/MCP;
Julia extensions/diagnostics and isolated analyzers; measured release preparation.

Editor UI checkpoint: compact primary navigation, anchored composer, starter
prompts, safe Markdown/code/file links, grouped tool cards, visible permission
cards, searchable/manageable conversations, structured settings and secure-key
status. Actual native GUI and VSIX Webview flows pass. Full Workbench typecheck
and two Node/Core transport tests pass. V3 Julia-specific requirements have been
rechecked in `docs/architecture/julia_feature_contract.md`; graph work is next.

Project-data checkpoint: stable Core facts/revisions/evidence, resident local
adjacency, checksummed transactional journal, real Go AST, native Tree-sitter
and actual CodeGraphContext/Ladybug backends. Impact/TestSelection/Architecture
are shared ordinary Julia analyzers. Nine 1/5/20-file incremental/full rebuild
oracles agree on a 21-file fixture; 108 integration assertions pass. Protocol
ownership/reload/deny/capacity tests pass. The Project view is connected to Core
jobs and approvals in both editor clients. Detailed limits and commands are in
`docs/core/project_data.md`. Syntax call links remain heuristic; CodeGraph has
global relink/export cost; compiler semantics, watcher/compaction and large-graph
evidence are pending. No Julia performance or live-model quality claim is made.

Julia diagnostics: concrete extension contract reflection, bounded actual
dispatch ambiguity scans, a permissioned invokelatest boundary and separately
executed fixed-target lowered/typed compiler reports. Tests include real missing
methods, deliberate dispatch ambiguity, a World Age failure/latest invocation,
permission denial, IR limits/UTF-8, actual child compilation and timeout.
CLI and the diagnostics tool expose the same implementation. See
`docs/core/julia_diagnostics.md`. This is trusted-Core introspection, not an OS
sandbox for generated analyzers or a completed extension package manager.

Only tested runnable checkpoints will be labeled verified. Update this file
after each checkpoint and push so another machine can resume without chat state.

Durable-task checkpoint: immutable validated DAGs, session/workspace ownership,
checksummed atomic updates, local dependency readiness, leased claims/start/
heartbeat/finish with token+generation fencing, conservative uncertain effects,
explicit reconciliation, safe bounded retries, exclusive effect barriers and
verified dependency result bindings. Tool/test/index/analysis/model dispatch
uses shared policies and budgets; model attempts own separate sessions; workers
exclude recursive task tools. Large results have bounded digest-checked artifacts.
Agent tools, CLI and async RPC use the same Core. Linux broad suite: 359 passing
assertions; final task-focused suite: 114 passing assertions, including actual
two-Julia-process contention and large process outputs. See docs/core/tasks.md
and docs/validation/tasks-checkpoint-008.json. No OS isolation, cross-machine
scheduler, mailbox, editable graph, task-history compaction or GUI Runtime
dashboard is claimed.

Primary-agent priority is explicit in docs/architecture/reference_synthesis.md:
Codex/OpenCode/DeepSeek Harness/Pi/Kimi/ZCode/Qwen remain the main research line.
All reference reviews are marked partial; specialist Hermes/Goose/SDK examples
do not replace the primary projects. Further references named in the history
remain to be evaluated. Next: MCP transport/discovery/lifecycle, followed by
remaining primary-agent and Julia-specific Core requirements.
